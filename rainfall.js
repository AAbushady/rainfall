/*
Write a program that stores the total rainfall for each of the 12 months of the year into an array. 
Use a random number for the rainfallâ€™s value. 
The program should determine which of the months had the least amount of rain.

I would first create a variable for the rainfall array and for an array holding the months.
Next I would declare a sorting function to use when we want to sort the array for gettting the lowest
rainfall value. After that It would be time to make a loop to populate the rainfall array with month prototypes,
these would have a month value and a rainfall value. Now we make use of the sort function, and display the
lowest month of rainfall.
*/

// Pseudocode
/*
--Variables and Constants--
Declare Empty Array rainfall.
Declare Constant Array MONTHS.
Declare Variable for sort function sorting from lowest to highest.


--Calculations--
Loop once for each month in the month array:
    Assign a random number between 1 and 10 to rainfall.
    Push an object of month with a values of rainMonth and rainValue.
Assign rainfall to rainfall being sorted from lowest to highest.
            
--Display Values--
Display "Welcome to Rainfall"
Display "I have aggregated the last 12 months of rainfall,"
Display "and figured out which month had the least rain!"
Display `My results indicate that ${rainfall[0].rainMonth} had the most rain.`
Display `${rainfall[0].rainMonth} had a total of ${rainfall[0].rainValue}" of rain!`
Display "Thank you for using Rainfall!"
